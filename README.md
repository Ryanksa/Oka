# Oka Home Page

Oka is a personal home page with basic features such as viewing top news and weather forecast. Moreover, users can log in with their google accounts to use the Workmap, which is a TODO list presented on an interactive board. Users may add, edit, and move around items on the Workmap to manage their tasks. Additionally, any task added under Workmap will also display on the home page in the due date order.

## Running Oka

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

to start the frontend server locally. The backend for this project is hooked up entirely to Firebase.
